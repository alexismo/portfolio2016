                With the marriage of 2 products come waves of change. Lightspeed Retail and Lightspeed eCom
                joined forces in 2016 to offer Omnichannel capabilities to its customers. This massively
                 shifted how the products worked and were used.
              </p>
              <p>
                Unifying experiences between navigations would solidify the usability and brand stickiness of both of these products.

                    Most seasoned Product Designers will tell you that it is much more difficult to change an 
                    existing feature than to build and deploy a new feature from scratch.
                    <br />
                    This case study shows how I was able to design, produce, and launch two full iterations
                    of a navigation bar, thus unifying navigation between Lightspeed products. 
                    <br />
                    <span class='am-bold'>Goal: </span>
                    enable the company to strengthen branding and scale to an even greater product offering, 
                    without affecting customers' usage of the product.
                </p>
              <p>
                Harmonize navigation of any number of Lightspeed core products while minimizing user confusion during the transition.

              <h3>Phase 1: &quot;move nothing&quot;</h3>
              <p>
                To get this project off the ground, the goal of our first iteration was to rougly align the visual styles
                of the sidebars of Lightspeed Retail and Lightspeed eCommerce products.
              </p>

              <p>
                This iteration was purposefully small. It allowed two product teams to align on practices and make decisions together.
                <br />
                The areas affected were: <span class="am-bold">spacing, colors, fonts, iconography.</span>
              </p>
              <h3>Testing of Phase 1</h3>
              <p>
                Before setting out to build and deploy phase 1 to customers, I built an <a href="https://framer.cloud/edQvM/" target="_blank">interactive prototype</a> in Framer to test out animation
                timings on hover effects. (<a href="https://framer.cloud/lzSdB/" target="_blank">well</a> 
                <a href="https://framer.cloud/IciVZ/" target="_blank">really</a> 
                <a href="https://framer.cloud/VOmSD/" target="_blank">I built more</a>, 
                <a href="https://framer.cloud/cbjUw/" target="_blank">but who's counting</a>)
              </p>
              <p>
                Testing occured on a number of internal stakeholders (support staff, customer success, growth managers) to
                validate whether they thought the designs would turn off customers. <span class="am-bold">It did not.</span>
                <br />
                Emails with attached screenshots were also sent to customers to get their impressions about this first rollout.
                <br />
                <span class="am-bold">Comments were positive,</span> we were clear for rollout.
              </p>
              <h3>Deployment of Phase 1</h3>
              <p>
                The deployment of sidebar phase 1 went smoothly. Release timing had not been coordinated, 
                and so the eCommerce sidebar was released a few days before the Retail sidebar.
                <br />
                To my pleasure, no customer called into support about this rollout.
                <br />
                <span class="am-bold">We had stuck the landing.</span>

                <h3>2. Growth & team buy-in (contributions & React)</h3>
                <p>
                  Developers and designers quickly gained interest in the Design System. All designers were already using the Sketch and Framer libraries
                  we had created for ultra-fast UI design and prototyping.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Developers from other teams who saw value in this Design System started using it and contributing back to it. This was amazing!
                  Very quickly, the number of components available to us was growing due to the positive feedback loop that the team had initiated.
                </p>
                <p>
                  In an collaborative decision, the contributors decided to evolve from CSS tokens & shared styles to React.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The move React components empowered designers to bring more types of components to the Design System.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For example, I worked to automate the creation of icons from Sketch-exported SVGs to  
                  React icon components with customizable 3-tone style.
                </p>

            <div class="col-12">
              <h3>3. Tabular expansion</h3>
              <p>Realizing the power the Design System on one hand and some inconsistent pages in our products,
                I rallied designers from each of the major 3 web products from Lightspeed to collaborate on the 
                design and conceptualization of a Table component: arguably the most complex component yet.
              </p>
              <p>To maximize usefulness for all developers, designer and, customers, 
                this Table component would have to support many workflows and modalities. I led interface inventories, competitive
                analyses, and many design workshops with stakeholders in order to get this right.
              </p>
              <p>
                We agreed on a design which supported all of the features the Table should have: 
                <strong>listing</strong>,
                <strong>search</strong>,
                <strong>sorting</strong>,
                <strong>filtering</strong>,
                <strong>summarizing</strong>,
                <strong>paginating</strong>,
                <strong>and more</strong>.
              </p>
              <div class="col-12 center">
                  <figure>
                      <img width="100%" src="images/projects/flame/filterTable.jpg" 
                      srcset="images/projects/flame/filterTable.jpg 1x, images/projects/flame/filterTable@2x.jpg 2x" 
                      alt="Filter Table from the Flame Design System" />

                  </figure>
              </div>
              <p>
                To test out assumptions about how the Table would be understood by its users, I built a total of 9 iterations of interactive prototypes 
                for the Table's filtering behaviour. This test was massively successful in identifying the wins and flaws of the table.

              <p>Link to the <a href="https://framer.cloud/KHpwX" target="_blank">Framer Table Filtering Prototype</a></p>
              <p>
                As I was building the prototype, I learned how to use anonymous functions with <code>map</code> and <code>filter</code>, 
                fetch mock data from the network, optmize rendering, and write modular single-resposibility code.
              </p>
              <p>I am very pleased that the Table is now an integral part of the Design System and in use by all product teams.</p>

                <h3>4. Birth of a team</h3>
                <p>
                  After a year and a half of building the Design System in a distributed way, I wanted to further increase the velocity and quality of the 
                  Design System. I pitched to key stakeholders the idea that the company should invest in a dedicated team for the Design System.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I put together a presentation outlining the benefits of spending dedicated resources to internal tooling. By attaching a dollar
                  value to the potential benefit of having a dedicated team, I was able to convince senior management to pull together people from existing
                  teams and new hires to form the Design System team. We are (at time of writing) 4 developers and 2 designers. I fall into the latter, and also was bestowed
                  the responsibility of being Product Manager. This has been a huge challenge for me, as I have never received training on how to be a Product Manager.
                </p>

                <h3>5. Hardening and evangelizing</h3>
                <p>
                  With a newfound team and hopeful hearts, the team transitioned from working on the Design System as an "innovation time" project
                  to treating it like a product. Our first initiative was to improve the developer experience of using the Design System. This meant
                  moving from CSS tokens and webpack configs to CSS-in-JS (using styled system) and distributed builds for the React Components. <br />
                  The improvements were significant.<br />
                  From a previously difficult-to-navigate experience which might take a mid-level front-end developer 2 hours to set up, we moved to a way of working
                  that required <i>less than 2 minutes to set up</i>.
                </p>
                <p>
                  The team now offered an easy-to-use solution for installation and usage of our UI components.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Gap analysis showed that our stakeholders (designers, developers, product managers, quality specialists) 
                  were being provided with very little guidance as to how, when, and why to use each component. This was to be our 
                  next leap forward as a product. I teamed up with the other designer on the team to design, develop, and launch a comprehensive 
                  documentation site for the Design System to boost <i>understanding and context</i> of the tools we were providing.
                </p>
                <p>After working for about 2 months continuously, the MVP for our site was done. By launch, it contained:
                  <ul style="list-style-type:circle; margin-left: 20px;">

                <p>Creating the site was not enough. Lightspeeders needed to know what it was, why it was good for them, and how to access it.
                  With that in mind, I organized and held 2 "lunch-and-learn" events at Lightspeed offices (in Amsterdam and Montreal) 
                  to properly launch the Design System Documentation website. This launch resulted in a <i>60% increase in visits to the site</i> week-over-week
                  from the previous soft-launch initiatives.
